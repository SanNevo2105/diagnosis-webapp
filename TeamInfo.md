## Project Summary

# Medical Decision Assistant

Our project aim is to create a website that assists the user with making medical decisions by listing out possible diseases they might have and their likelihood based on the user’s input symptoms, suggesting which type of doctor to consult, and estimating the consultant fee based on user’s location and the type of doctor they will be consulting. The website will also display information about the commercial medicines associated with the disease, including their descriptions, substitutes, and side effects.

As for additional features, the user can also directly search for information about the diseases to display their symptoms, specialized doctors, consultant fees, and drug information. Specific drugs can also be directly searched up to display their information and the diseases they are associated with.
